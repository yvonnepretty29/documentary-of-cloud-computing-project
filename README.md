# Scalable and Secure Cloud Infrastructure Design  

This repository contains the design and implementation of a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure for Sage, utilizing AWS and Azure services to ensure data security, operational efficiency, and compliance with industry standards.  

## Overview  

The project involves:  
- Designing scalable cloud architectures.  
- Implementing robust security measures.  
- Developing disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  

## Key Features  

### Infrastructure Design  
- **Access Control**: Implementation of IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control.  
- **Data Encryption**: Leveraged AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for encrypting sensitive data.  
- **Network Security**: Configured security groups and segmented networks into public and private subnets for enhanced security.  
- **Scalable Computing**: Utilized EC2/VM, ECS/Kubernetes, and serverless functions like AWS Lambda.  

### Storage Solutions  
- **Static Assets**: S3/Blob storage for high durability and availability.  
- **Relational Databases**: RDS/SQL Database to handle structured data.  
- **Compute Storage**: EBS/Disk storage for performance-critical operations.  

### Networking  
- **VPC/Virtual Network**: Isolated and secure environments.  
- **Load Balancing**: Configured ELB/ALB for traffic distribution.  

### Operational Efficiency  
- **Automation**: CloudFormation or Resource Manager for efficient resource management.  
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling groups to handle variable workloads.  
- **Monitoring**: Integrated CloudWatch/Monitor for real-time logging and alerting.  

### Disaster Recovery  
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 4 hours.  
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 2 hours.  
- Regular backup schedules with differential and incremental methods.  

## Compliance and Security  
- **Compliance Standards**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001.  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure sensitive data both in transit and at rest.  
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforced RBAC with MFA for sensitive operations.
